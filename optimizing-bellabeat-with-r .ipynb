Summary </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"summary_1\"></a>\n\nBellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. They develop wearable and accompanying products that monitor biometric and lifestyle data to help women to better understand how their bodies work and make healthier choices. \n\nThe problem that the Bellabeat company is trying to solve, is to unlock new growth opportunities. According to [GrandViewResearch](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fitness-tracker-market), the global fitness tracker market size was valued at USD 34.6 billion in 2020, USD 41.3 billion in 2021, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.9% from 2021 to 2028. Some of the key players in the global fitness tracker market are: Apple, Inc., Fitbit, Inc., Garmin Ltd., Beienda, Ambiotex GmbH, Hexoskin, Huawei Technologies, Nurvv, Oura Health Ltd., Withings.\n\n[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) is a successful small company, but they have the potential to grow and become a larger player in the global smart device market. The purpose of this study is to focus one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices\n\n\n# <span style=\"color:#000000\"> 2.

By outlining the process of the analysis and the key findings, high-level recommendations for marketing strategies will be presented to the key stakeholders. In this case study, I will focus on Bellabeat App for recommendations.\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:#797979\"> 2.2 Questions for the analysis <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"questions_for_the_ analysis_2_2\"></a> \n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n\n### Key Stakeholders:\n\n* **Sando Mur** — Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n\n* **Urška Sršen** — Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n\n* **Bellabeat marketing analytics team** — A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n\n## <span style=\"color:#000000\"> 3. Prepare Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prepare_phase_3\"></a> \n\n#### <span style=\"color:#797979\"> 3.1 Data location <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Data_location_3_1\"></a> \n\nThe data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius. \n    \n\n#### <span style=\"color:#797979\"> 3.2 Data organization and verification <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"Data_ organization_and_verification_3_2\"></a> \n\nWhat is available to us are 18 CSV documents. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit.The data is considered long since each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.\n\nDue to the small size of sample I sorted and filtered tables creating Pivot Tables in spreedsheet. I was able to verify attributes and observations of each table and relations between tables. Counted sample size (users) of each table and verified time length of analysis - 31 days. \n\n\n| Table Name | Type | Description |\n|--- | --- | --- |\n| dailyActivity_merged | Google sheets | Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 users.

Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.  \n\n\n    \n#### <span style=\"color:#797979\"> 3.5 Data Credibility and Integrity:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"data_credibility_and_integrity_3_5\"></a> \n\nWe may experience sampling bias due to the small sample size (30 users) and the lack of demographic data. We don't know if the sample reflect the overall population. \nAnother issue we'd face is that the dataset isn't up to date, as well as the survey's time restriction (2 months long). As a result, we'll use an operational approach to our case study.\n\n\n# <span style=\"color:#000000\">  4.

Conclusion (Act Phase) </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion_act_phase\"></a>\n\nBellabeat's mission is to empower women by providing them with the data to discover themselves.\n\nIn order for us to respond to our business task and help Bellabeat on their mission, based on our results, I would advice to use own tracking data for further analysis. \nDatasets used have a small sample and can be biased since we didn't have any demographic details of users. Knowing that our main target are young and adult women I would encourage to continue finding trends to be able to create a marketing strategy focused on them. \n\nThat being said, after our analysis we have found different trends that may help our online campaign and improve **Bellabeat app**: \n\n|Recommendation| Description |\n|---| ---|\n|1. Daily notification on steps and posts on app| We classified users into 4 categories and saw that the average of users walk more than 7,500 steps daily besides Sundays. We can encourage customers to reach at least daily recommended steps by CDC - 8.000 **sending them alarms if they haven't reached the steps and creating also posts on our app explaining the benefits of reaching that goal**. As CDC explains the more steps you walk the lower is the mortality rate. We also saw a positive correlation between steps and calories.|\n|2. Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock| Based on our results we can see that users sleep less than 8 hours a day. **They can show how long you have been in each stage of sleep and give you any advice to improve your sleep.**. Also offer helpfull resources to help customers sleep - ex. breathing advises, podcasts and a combination of guided meditation, melodies and sounds to soothe sleep, records sleep habits to wake you up as you enter your lightest sleep phase.|\n|3. Reward system | We are aware that some people don't get motivated by notifications so we could create a kind of game on our app for a limited period of time. **Game would consist in reaching different levels based on amount of steps walked every day**. You need to maintain activity level for a period of time (maybe a month) to pass to the next level. For each level you would win certain amount of stars that would be redeemable for merchandise or discount on other Bellabeat products.|\n|4. Social networks |[Studies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/10/151007110738.htm) have shown that Social networks can motivate people to exercise more Compared to motivational messaging, the social influence of online peers proved more effective in improving exercise habits.|\n\n\n\nOn our analysis we didn't just check trends on daily users habits we also realized that just 50% of the users use their device on a daily basis and that just 36% of the users wear the device all time the day they used it. We can continue promote Bellabeat's products features: \n\n* Water-resistant  \n* Long-lasting batteries \n* Fashion/ elegant products \n\nYou can wear the products everyday to any occasion without worrying about the battery.
